        <a href="./index.html"><h5>everyone has a secret or something to tell, i think you should confess and no one would recognize you anyway.</h5></a><br>
        <p>do you love someone? or maybe you broke up and deep down it hurts too much? would you rather save the world and die as a hero or let the world die so you don't suffer?
            are you sick? are you afraid of death? are you interested in death? maybe your morbid curiosities are painful now. have you stolen something? maybe you've stolen from 
            someone, or hurt someone? you've tried to kill someone before. would you rather save the world and die as a hero or let the world die so you don't suffer? 
            do you order too much on the internet? have you ever mistreated an animal? have you ever thrown your cigarette on the sidewalk ? have you ever bought a new phone when your old 
            one was working fine? have you dreamt about her all night? do you think love is pointless? Don't you like sex? Are you afraid of your sexuality? Do you often think about sex?
            Maybe you should sleep longer at night, go to bed earlier. you don't really eat or you eat too much. You don't like the way you look, you want to change your body like on The Sims? 
            Your doctor tells you to do more exercise? Dreaming of a sport you find too complicated to play? You're too old for all that. You're too young to understand life. Does everyone 
            get on your nerves? Are people just plain mean and nasty? What can you do to improve yourself? Have you ever googled “how to make money without working”? Would you like wealth to 
            be distributed equally? Would you like all the money for yourself and everyone else to starve even more? You don't want to talk politics because you think it's pointless? Don't 
            you really know who you are anymore? What are you? You feel like you've never been anyone until now. Do you think your parents hate you and that your family talks badly about you 
            behind your back? You don't want to see your racist and homophobic grandparents anymore? You would like to make your coming-out but you do not know how to do it? You're not what 
            society wants you to be. You prefer not to be called. You don't like receiving text messages. Or maybe you're just waiting for someone to text you and ask you out. You don't 
            leave the house, you don't see anyone. Do you have any friends? Do you have too many friends? Who do you hate the most?
